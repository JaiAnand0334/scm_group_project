Address Book
n address book is like a treasure trove of connections, a digital or physical repository where you can store all the vital information about your contacts.
It's like a personal directory that keeps your friends, family, colleagues, and acquaintances organized and easily accessible.
In the digital age, address books have evolved from the traditional paper notebooks to sophisticated digital databases stored on computers, smartphones, or in the cloud.
